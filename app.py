Many UFO sightings are said to be naturally occurring phenomena, such as
ball lightning or strange cloud formations, which have been mistakenly identified.
In the famous case of the Lubbock Lights in 1951, three science professors from
Texas Tech saw what appeared to be a semi-circle of lights in the sky. A US Air
Force investigation concluded the lights were birds reflecting the cityâ€™s new
street lights but later said it was a natural phenomenon. People have been using
a wide variety of descriptions for the shape of the sighting.
